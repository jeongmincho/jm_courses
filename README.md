# JM Courses: Princeton Course Listing Website

This website is a simple remake of the Princeton University course registrar site.

## Reflection on Assignment

This assignment was an exciting project to experience developing a website from scratch for the first time. Despite the lack of time to fully immerse in the modern web development process by learning to utilize frameworks to build a fully functioning web application, the journey of coding a Python server with SimpleHTTPServer, linking the queries to a SQLite3 Database, and programming a simple client user interface allowed me to see the big picture of web development and learn more about the heavy-lifting "batteries" that are often included in popular web frameworks today.

## Improvements to the assignment

Although a good amount of learning comes with the struggles of guiding oneself through the sea of options, the assignment would have been a much more enjoyable process if we had more time to pick up a modern web framework (ex. React, Angular, Vue) in order to learn web technologies that are directly relevant to the industry today. Many of the difficulties in the assignment came with manually linking the database and the backend server, which would have been more streamlined had we used a framework. All in all, the assignment was a great experience.
