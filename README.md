# JM Courses: Princeton Course Listing Website

[This website](https://jmcourses.herokuapp.com/) is a simple remake of the Princeton University course registrar site.

## Reflection on Project

This project was an attempt to create a website from scratch using Python and an SQL database in order to better understand the inner workings of web frameworks. Coding a Python server with SimpleHTTPServer, linking the queries to a SQLite3 Database, and programming a simple client user interface allowed me to see the big picture of web development and learn more about the heavy-lifting "batteries" that are often included in popular web frameworks today.

## Improvements to the Project

The assignment was an overall success, because it was a struggle and a learning experience. Setting up a server with SQLite3 and manually linking the queries was much more tedious than expected. Meanwhile, deployment onto Heroku was another bug-heavy task. In the end, the work paid off as I was able to learn more about why modern web frameworks are utilized in the industry and the difficulties of coding a fullstack website from scratch.
